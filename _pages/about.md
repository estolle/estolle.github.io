* We study the Evolutionary Genomics of Phenotypic Innovation in a variety of invertebrate organisms
* this includes adaptive phenotypic innovation or loss, social evolution, thelytoky & clonal reproduction, phenotypic convergence and mimicry, nutritional specialization and parasitism.
* We use conparative and experimental approaches in population genomics, developmental genomics and structural genomics
* Currently our main study systems are honeybees, bumblebees, stingless bees, solitary bees, wasps and hoverflies.
* Our lab is located at the ZFMK (Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig) in Bonn (Germany), the Leibniz Institute of Animal Biodiversity: Section Comparative Insect Genomics.
