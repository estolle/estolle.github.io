* We study the Evolutionary Genomics of Phenotypic Innovation in a variety of invertebrate organisms, including adaptive phenotypic innovation, adaptive loss, social evolution, thelytokous reproduction, phenotypic convergence and mimicry, nutritional specialization and parasitism
* We use comparative and experimental approaches in population and structural genomics in Evo-Devo frameworks, currently mainly in honey-, bumble, stingless and solitary bees, but also in solitary wasps and hoverflies
* We are located at the ZFMK (Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig) in Bonn (Germany), the Leibniz Institute of Animal Biodiversity: Section Comparative Insect Genomics.
